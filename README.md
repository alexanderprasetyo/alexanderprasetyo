## :computer: Projects :

While I was studying in Data Science Bootcamp by Hacktiv8, I have done some works and projects and ofcourse it's all about data science stuff related. You can find all my works and learnings in these repositories:

- [h8-learning-journey](https://github.com/alexanderprasetyo/h8-learning-journey) : This repository contains all of my notes for 3 months. Phase 0 is the first month which talks about the fundamentals for data science such as pandas, numpy, statistics. Phase 1 is the second month which covers the machine learning stuffs and it goes from supervised machine learning to unsupervised machine learning with the help of SciKit-Learn. Phase 2 is the last month of studying in Data Science and in this phase I learned some stuffs about Deep Learning using TensorFlow.
- [DataScienceProjects](https://github.com/alexanderprasetyo/DataScienceProjects) : There are 3 sub-directory in this repository and each sub-dir is a different project.

## Last Words

I am not a perfect or the expert of programming, data analysis, data science but I have a strong will to learn those stuffs! It's never too late to learn, isn't it? That's it from me! Have a good day!
